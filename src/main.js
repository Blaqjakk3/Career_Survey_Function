AVAILABLE CAREER PATHS:

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Analyze the user's profile against each career path
2. Consider career stage-specific factors:
   - Pathfinder: Focus on learning potential, entry requirements, growth opportunities
   - Trailblazer: Focus on career advancement, skill building, leadership opportunities  
   - Horizon Changer: Focus on transferable skills, transition feasibility, motivation alignment

3. Provide detailed matching with:
   - Match score (0-100)
   - Specific reasoning for the match (SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE USER using "you", "your", etc.)
   - User's strengths for this path (use "you have", "your experience", etc.)
   - Areas needing development (use "you should focus on", "you could improve", etc.)
   - Actionable recommendations (use "you can", "you should consider", etc.)

4. IMPORTANT: All text should be written as if you are speaking directly to the user. Use "you", "your", "you have", "you should", etc. Never refer to the user in third person.

5. Return top 5 matches in JSON format:
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "careerPathId": "path_id",
      "matchScore": 85,
      "reasoning": "Your background in [field] aligns perfectly with this role because...",
      "strengths": ["You have strong skills in X", "Your experience with Y", "Your interest in Z"],
      "developmentAreas": ["You should focus on developing X", "You could improve your Y skills"],
      "recommendations": ["You can start by taking courses in X", "You should consider building projects in Y", "You might benefit from networking in Z"]
    }
  ]
}

Focus on realistic, actionable matches that consider the user's current situation and career stage. Remember to always speak directly to the user using second person pronouns.`;
